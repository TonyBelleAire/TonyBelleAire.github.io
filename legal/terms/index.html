                    While using the App, you will have access to: (i) content that you upload or provide ("Your Content"); (ii) content that other users upload or provide ("Member Content"); (iii) content that BelleAire provides on and through our Services ("Our Content") and (iv) ads or other content offered by third parties (“Third Party Content”). In this agreement, "content" includes, without limitation, all text, images, video, audio, or other material on our Services, including information on users' profiles and in direct messages between users.
                </p>
                <h3>Your Content</h3>
                <p>
                    You are solely responsible and liable for Your Content, and, therefore, you agree to indemnify, defend, release, and hold us harmless from any claims made in connection with Your Content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You represent and warrant to us that the information you provide to us or any other user is accurate, including any information submitted through third-party sources, and that you will update your account information as necessary to ensure its accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The content included on your individual profile should be relevant to the intended use of the App, that is to connect with and meet other users. You may not upload any Prohibited Content. If you choose to reveal any personal information about yourself to other users, you do so at your own risk. We encourage you to use caution in disclosing any personal information online.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may provide tools and features to enhance individual expression through Your Content and Member Content, and we are constantly developing new technologies to improve our services. Certain tools or features may allow you to generate or enhance content based on Your Content. This is still Your Content, and you are responsible for it and its accuracy, as well as your use of it on our services and any and all decisions made, actions taken, and failures to act based on Your Content. Be careful in choosing and sharing Your Content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You understand and agree that we may monitor or review Your Content, and we have the right to remove, delete, edit, limit, or block or prevent access to any of Your Content at any time at our sole discretion. Furthermore, you understand and agree that we have no obligation to display or review Your Content.

                <p>
                    Your individual profile will be visible to other people around the world, so be sure that you are comfortable sharing Your Content before you post. You acknowledge and agree that Your Content may be viewed by other users, and, notwithstanding these Terms, other users may share Your Content with third parties. By uploading Your Content, you represent and warrant to us that you have all necessary rights and licenses to do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By using the App, you agree to grant us a worldwide, continuing, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, license to host, store, copy, display, reproduce, create derivative works from, adapt, edit, translate, modify and otherwise use Your Content, in any medium known or to be known, as we see fit, subject to applicable law.

                <h3>Member Content</h3>
                <p>
                    Other users will also share content on our services. Member Content belongs to the user who posted the content and is stored on our servers and displayed at the direction of that user.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You should always carefully review and independently verify Member Content for accuracy. Other users may use tools to generate or enhance content based on the Member Content they provide.  Member Content may include biased, incorrect, harmful, offensive, or misleading information. Other users are responsible for their Member Content, as well as any and all decisions made, actions taken, and failures to act based on their use of Member Content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You do not have any rights in relation to Member Content, and, unless authorized by the user who posted the content, you may only use Member Content to the extent that your use is consistent with the App’s purpose of allowing communication and meeting one another. You may not copy the Member Content or use Member Content for commercial purposes, to spam, to harass, or to make unlawful threats. We reserve the right to terminate your account if you misuse Member Content.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Content</h3>
                <p>
                    Any other text, content, graphics, user interfaces, trademarks, logos, sounds, artwork, images, and other intellectual property appearing on the App is owned, controlled or licensed by us and protected by copyright, trademark and other intellectual property law rights.

                </p>
                <p>
                    For as long as you comply with these Terms, we grant you a limited license to access and use Our Content for the purposes of using the App to match with and meet other users, and we reserve all other rights. The license is personal, non-assignable, worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, revocable, and non-sublicensable.
                </p>
                <h3>Third-Party Content</h3>
                <p>
                    We are not responsible for the availability (or lack of availability) of any external websites or resources or their content. Furthermore, BelleAire is not responsible for, and does not endorse, any products or services that may be offered by third-party websites or resources. If you choose to interact with the third parties made available through our App, the third party's terms will govern their relationship with you. We are not responsible or liable for third parties' terms, actions, or content.
                </p>
                <h2>Paid Products and Services</h2>
                <p>
                    We may, at our discretion, offer products or services that are available for purchase either as one-time payments or subscription-based services. When we receive payment information for any subscription-based services, we will automatically renew the subscription at the end of each subscription period until it is canceled by you or the services are discontinued. Renewals will result in automatic payment. If you cancel your subscription, you will not be refunded, but the subscription services will continue to be accessible until the end of that subscription period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some operating systems, such as Apple ID or Google Play, permit subscription management through an external service provider. If you do not want your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription and you paid with an external service, you must log in to your external service account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have otherwise deleted your account with us or if you have deleted the App from your device.
                </p>
                <h2>Account Termination</h2>
                <p>
                    BelleAire reserves the right to investigate and, if appropriate, suspend or terminate your account without a refund if BelleAire believes that you have violated these Terms, misused our services, or behaved in a way that we regard as inappropriate or unlawful, on or off the App. We reserve the right to make use of any personal, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms, at any time without liability and without the obligation to give you prior notice, including, but not limited to, preventing you from accessing the App.
                </p>
                <p>

Your information will be maintained and deleted in accordance with our <a href="/legal/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    THE APP, OUR CONTENT, MEMBER CONTENT, AND THIRD-PARTY CONTENT ARE ALL PROVIDED TO YOU “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.
