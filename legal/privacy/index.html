We want you to establish a connection with somebody for reasons other than a great profile photo. But for safety and identity verification reasons, we do require you to submit a recent selfie shortly before meeting up with your match. We also use your selfies to train our app to provide you the best matches possible.</td>

                            <td>We may use this information for identity verification if we opt to do so, but primarily we use it to store sessions locally on your devices and track your settings as well as app crashes and other bugs that might need fixing.</td>
